          <strong>Real-time vehicle locations</strong> of buses and trains are
          obtained from Auckland Transport's public API. The data on the map is
          updated once every <strong>{refresh} seconds</strong>. Animations are
          interpolated between consecutive locations (so don't worry if you see
          a bus swimming in the WaitematƒÅ).

          Map points are coloured by the bus's <strong>occupancy status</strong>
          , which indicates the number of passengers on board.
